# whats-the-weather-like

This weeks challenge was to create a weather app utilizing server side API. When the user gives the location, it is saved to local storage and the days forecast, as well as the future forecast, is saved to local storage as an array, then certain elements are printed to the page.

# html

1. created index.html page
2. added script tags, jquery ui, bootstrap and googlefont. 
3. created a form, and lanes using cs grid in bootstrap. 


# css

1. created style.css page
2. created minimal css using this, most was done in bootstrap or js.

# javascript/jquery

1. created javascript page
2. created multiple functions in tandem with the server side api in order to: utilize client input data to pull location, current and future weather forecast and store it locally to browser. Then print it to page. 
3. Check comments in JS to see individual steps.
